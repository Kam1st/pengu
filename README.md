# Penguin Valentine 💕

A cute Valentine's Day page: "Do you want to be my Valentine?" with a photo placeholder, a **Yes** button that shows a congrats screen, and a **No** button that runs away when you hover near it.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. **Add your photo:** In `index.html`, find the photo placeholder div and either:
   - Put your image in the same folder as `index.html` and add inside the placeholder:
     ```html
     <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Us">
     ```
   - Or remove the `<span>Your photo here 💕</span>` and keep the `<img>` with your file name.

That's it. Have a happy Valentine's!
